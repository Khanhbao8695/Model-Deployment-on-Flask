# Model-Deployment-on-Flask

The Flask web had been developed to predict the house price based on different variables in the selected area from “USA Housing” [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aariyan101/usa-housingcsv) from Kaggle: Average Income, Average House Age, Average Number of Room, Average  of Bedroom in Area, and Area Population. This is part of my projects when working with Data Glacier
